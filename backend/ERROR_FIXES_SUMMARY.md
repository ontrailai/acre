# Lease Logik Error Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Missing asyncio import in advanced_chunker.py (FIXED ✓)
- **Error**: `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'asyncio' referenced before assignment`
- **Location**: `/backend/app/core/advanced_chunker.py` line 910
- **Fix**: Added `import asyncio` inside the try block in `chunk_lease` function

### 2. JSON format error in AI-native extraction (FIXED ✓)
- **Error**: `'messages' must contain the word 'json' in some form, to use 'response_format' of type 'json_object'`
- **Location**: Multiple files using OpenAI API with `response_format={"type": "json_object"}`
- **Fix**: Added "Return your response in valid JSON format." to all prompts in:
  - `/backend/app/core/ai_native_extractor.py` (12 prompts fixed)
  - `/backend/app/core/multi_pass_extractor.py` (2 prompts fixed)

### 3. Slice indices error in AI-native extraction
- **Error**: `slice indices must be integers or None or have an __index__ method`
- **Location**: `/backend/app/core/ai_native_extractor.py`
- **Fix**: Added type checking and conversion for chunk boundaries to ensure they are integers

## Summary

All critical errors have been fixed:
1. The advanced chunker now properly imports asyncio when needed
2. All GPT-4 API calls using JSON response format now include "json" in the prompt
3. The AI-native extractor properly handles chunk boundaries as integers

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test lease processing with a simple PDF file
2. Verify that the advanced chunking works without asyncio errors
3. Confirm that AI-native extraction doesn't fail with JSON format errors
4. Check that multi-pass extraction works correctly

## Additional Notes

The errors were primarily related to:
- Asyncio event loop handling in synchronous contexts
- OpenAI API requirements for JSON response format
- Type safety in the AI-native extractor

All fixes maintain backward compatibility and don't change the core functionality.
