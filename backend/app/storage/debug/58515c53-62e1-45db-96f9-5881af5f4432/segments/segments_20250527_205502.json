Their bodies are about 1/16 of an inch in length. They have \nalmost no color. When a bed bug feeds, its body swells, may lengthen, and becomes bright red, sometimes making it \nappear to be a different insect. Bed bugs do not fly. They can either crawl or be carried from place to place on objects, \npeople, or animals. Bed bugs can be hard to find and identify because they are tiny and try to stay hidden.",

A \nperson\u2019s reaction to insect bites is an immune response and so varies from person to person. Sometimes the red welts \ncaused by the bites will not be noticed until many days after a person was bitten, if at all.\nCommon signs and symptoms of a possible bed bug infestation:\n\u2022 Small red to reddish brown fecal spots on mattresses, box springs, bed frames, mattresses, linens, upholstery, or walls.\n\u2022 Molted bed bug skins, white, sticky eggs, or empty eggshells.\n\u2022 Very heavily infested areas may have a characteristically sweet odor.\n\u2022 Red, itchy bite marks, especially on the legs, arms, and other body parts exposed while sleeping.

Did you know that many homes built before 1978 have lead-based \npaint? Lead from paint, chips, and dust can pose serious health \nhazards. Read this entire brochure to learn: \n\u2022 How lead gets into the body\n\u2022 How lead afects health\n\u2022 What you can do to protect your family\n\u2022 Where to go for more information\nBefore renting or buying a pre-1978 home or apartment, federal \nlaw requires: \n\u2022 Sellers must disclose known information on lead-based paint or lead-\nbased paint hazards before selling a house. \u2022 Real estate sales contracts must include a specifc warning statement\nabout lead-based paint. Buyers have up to 10 days to check for lead. \u2022 Landlords must disclose known information on lead-based paint\nor lead-based paint hazards before leases take efect. Leases must\ninclude a specifc warning statement about lead-based paint. If undertaking renovations, repairs, or painting (RRP) projects in \nyour pre-1978 home or apartment: \n\u2022 Read EPA\u2019s pamphlet, The Lead-Safe Certifed Guide to Renovate Right,\nto learn about the lead-safe work practices that contractors are\nrequired to follow when working in your home (see page 12). Simple Steps to Protect Your Family \nfrom Lead Hazards \nIf you think your home has lead-based paint: \n\u2022 Don\u2019t try to remove lead-based paint yourself. \u2022 Always keep painted surfaces in good condition to minimize \ndeterioration. \u2022 Get your home checked for lead hazards. Find a certifed \ninspector or risk assessor at epa.gov/lead. \u2022 Talk to your landlord about fxing surfaces with peeling or \nchipping paint. \u2022 Regularly clean foors, window sills, and other surfaces. \u2022 Take precautions to avoid exposure to lead dust when \nremodeling. \u2022 When renovating, repairing, or painting, hire only EPA- or state-\napproved Lead-Safe certifed renovation frms. \u2022 Before buying, renting, or renovating your home, have it \nchecked for lead-based paint. \u2022 Consult your health care provider about testing your children \nfor lead. Your pediatrician can check for lead with a simple \nblood test. \u2022 Wash children\u2019s hands, bottles, pacifers, and toys often. \u2022 Make sure children eat healthy, low-fat foods high in iron, \ncalcium, and vitamin C. \u2022 Remove shoes or wipe soil of shoes before entering your \nhouse. 1 \nLead Gets into the Body in Many Ways \nAdults and children can get lead into their bodies if they: \n\u2022 Breathe in lead dust (especially during activities such as renovations, \nrepairs, or painting that disturb painted surfaces). \u2022 Swallow lead dust that has settled on food, food preparation surfaces, \nand other places. \u2022 Eat paint chips or soil that contains lead. Lead is especially dangerous to children under the age of 6. \u2022 At this age, children\u2019s brains \nand nervous systems are \nmore sensitive to the \ndamaging efects of lead. \u2022 Children\u2019s growing bodies \nabsorb more lead. \u2022 Babies and young children \noften put their hands \nand other objects in their \nmouths. These objects can \nhave lead dust on them. Women of childbearing age should know that lead is dangerous to \na developing fetus. \u2022 Women with a high lead level in their system before or during \npregnancy risk exposing the fetus to lead through the placenta \nduring fetal development. 2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHealth Efects of Lead \nLead afects the body in many ways. It is important to know that \neven exposure to low levels of lead can severely harm children. In children, exposure to lead can cause: \nBrain Nerve Damage \nHearing \n\u2022 Nervous system and kidney damage \n\u2022 Learning disabilities, attention-defcit \ndisorder, and decreased intelligence \n\u2022 Speech, language, and behavior \nproblems \n\u2022 Poor muscle coordination \n\u2022 Decreased muscle and bone growth \n\u2022 Hearing damage \nProblems \nSlowed \nGrowth \nDigestive \nProblems \nReproductive \nProblems \n(Adults) \nWhile low-lead exposure is most common, \nexposure to high amounts of lead can have \ndevastating efects on children, including \nseizures, unconsciousness, and in some cases, death. Although children are especially susceptible to lead exposure, lead can \nbe dangerous for adults, too. In adults, exposure to lead can cause: \n\u2022 Harm to a developing fetus \n\u2022 Increased chance of high blood pressure during pregnancy \n\u2022 Fertility problems (in men and women) \n\u2022 High blood pressure \n\u2022 Digestive problems \n\u2022 Nerve disorders \n\u2022 Memory and concentration problems \n\u2022 Muscle and joint pain \n3 \nCheck Your Family for Lead \nGet your children and home tested if you think your home has \nlead. Children\u2019s blood lead levels tend to increase rapidly from 6 to 12 \nmonths of age, and tend to peak at 18 to 24 months of age. Consult your doctor for advice on testing your children. A simple blood \ntest can detect lead. Blood lead tests are usually recommended for: \n\u2022 Children at ages 1 and 2 \n\u2022 Children or other family members who have been exposed to high \nlevels of lead \n\u2022 Children who should be tested under your state or local health \nscreening plan \nYour doctor can explain what the test results mean and if more \ntesting will be needed. 4 \n \n  \n \n  \nWhere Lead-Based Paint Is Found \nIn general, the older your home or childcare facility, the more likely it \nhas lead-based paint.1 \nMany homes, including private, federally-assisted, federally-\nowned housing, and childcare facilities built before 1978 have \nlead-based paint. In 1978, the federal government banned consumer \nuses of lead-containing paint.2 \nLearn how to determine if paint is lead-based paint on page 7. Lead can be found: \n\u2022 In homes and childcare facilities in the city, country, or suburbs, \n\u2022 In private and public single-family homes and apartments, \n\u2022 On surfaces inside and outside of the house, and \n\u2022 In soil around a home. (Soil can pick up lead from exterior paint or \nother sources, such as past use of leaded gas in cars.) \nLearn more about where lead is found at epa.gov/lead. 1 \u201cLead-based paint\u201d is currently defned by the federal government as paint with \nlead levels greater than or equal to 1.0 milligram per square centimeter (mg/cm2), or \nmore than 0.5% by weight. 2 \u201cLead-containing paint\u201d is currently defned by the federal government as lead in new \ndried paint in excess of 90 parts per million (ppm) by weight. 5 \n \n \n \nIdentifying Lead-Based Paint and Lead-Based Paint \nHazards \nDeteriorated lead-based paint (peeling, chipping, chalking, \ncracking, or damaged paint) is a hazard and needs immediate \nattention. Lead-based paint may also be a hazard when found on \nsurfaces that children can chew or that get a lot of wear and tear, \nsuch as: \n\u2022 On windows and window sills \n\u2022 Doors and door frames \n\u2022 Stairs, railings, banisters, and porches \nLead-based paint is usually not a hazard if it is in good condition \nand if it is not on an impact or friction surface like a window. Lead dust can form when lead-based paint is scraped, sanded, or \nheated. Lead dust also forms when painted surfaces containing \nlead bump or rub together. Lead paint chips and dust can get on \nsurfaces and objects that people touch. Settled lead dust can reenter \nthe air when the home is vacuumed or swept, or when people walk \nthrough it. EPA currently defnes the following levels of lead in dust as \nhazardous: \n\u2022 10 micrograms per square foot (\u03bcg/ft2) and higher for foors, \nincluding carpeted foors \n\u2022 100 \u03bcg/ft2 and higher for interior window sills \nLead in soil can be a hazard when children play in bare soil or when \npeople bring soil into the house on their shoes.",
