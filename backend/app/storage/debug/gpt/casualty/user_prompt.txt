CLAUSE TEXT:
Option to Terminate. If during the Term either the Premises or any portion 
of the Building, the Common Areas, the total leased area,  or the Property are Substantially 
Damaged or Destroyed by fire or other casualty, Landlord shall have the option (which it may 
exercise by giving written notice thereof to Tenant within sixty (60) days after the date on which 
such Substantial Damage or Destruction occurs) to terminate this Lease as of the date specified 
in such notice (which date shall not be earlier than the thirtieth (30th) day after such notice is 
given). “Substantial Damage and Destruction” and “Substantially Damaged or Destroyed” 
shall mean serious damage or destruction rendering unusable 33% or more of the rentable square 
feet of the Premises, the Food Court Common Area and/or the total square footage of the 
Building.  On such termination, Tenant shall pay to Landlord all Base Rent, Rent and other sums 
and charges payable by Tenant hereunder and accrued through such date (as justly apportioned to 
the date of such termination). If Landlord does not terminate this Lease pursuant to this Section 
15.1, Landlord shall restore the Building and/or Premises as soon thereafter as is reasonably 
possible, but not longer than 90 days, to their condition on the date of completion of Landlord's 
Work, taking into account any delay experienced by Landlord in recovering the proceeds of any 
insurance policy payable on account of such damage or destruction and in obtaining any
necessary permits and, failing such, Tenant may terminate this Lease. Until the Premises are so 
repaired, the Base Rent (and each installment thereof) and the Rent shall abate in proportion to 
the floor area or essential operating area of so much, if any, of the Premises as is rendered 
substantially unusable by Tenant by such damage or destruction.   
15.2 
No Termination of Lease.  Except as is otherwise expressly permitted by 
Section 15.1, no total or partial damage to or destruction of any or all of the Premises shall 
entitle either party hereto to surrender or terminate this Lease, or shall relieve Tenant from its 
liability hereunder to pay in full the Base Rent, any Rent and all other sums and charges which 
are otherwise payable by Tenant hereunder, or from any of its other obligations hereunder, and 
Tenant hereby waives any right now or hereafter conferred upon it by statute or otherwise, on 
account of any such damage or destruction, to surrender this Lease, to quit or surrender any or all 
of the Premises, or to have any suspension, diminution, abatement or reduction of the Base Rent 
or any Rent or other sum payable by Tenant hereunder.
