Fees, and any other amounts that Tenant is or becomes obligated to pay Landlord under this 
Lease.  Tenant shall pay Landlord Rent without any deduction, recoupment, set-off or counter-

practicable after Substantial Completion of Landlord’s Work, Landlord shall actually measure 
the rentable area of the Premises and the Building and shall deliver to Tenant an architect’s

of the Building.  All measurements will be made in accordance with the most recent standards 
established by the Building Owners and Managers Association (commonly known as “BOMA”) 
for the measurement of retail and/or civic space as appropriate.  If the Premises rentable area is 
different than as set forth in the Premises definition above or in the Lease Schedule and/or the 
Common Areas are different than as set forth in the Building definition above, then Base Rent 
and Tenant’s Pro Rata Share will be appropriately adjusted based on such actual usable area.  
The area as so computed is referred to herein as the Net Usable Area.  The Net Usable Area shall 
be multiplied by a factor, as set forth in the Lease Schedule (load factor) to determine the Gross 
Rentable Area. The parties hereto recognize that the Premises for all purposes herein shall be 
deemed to be as set forth herein; provided, that if at any time hereafter any portion of the 
Premises becomes no longer subject to this Lease, “Premises” shall thereafter mean so much 
thereof as remains subject to this Lease.
