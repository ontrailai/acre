EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Identify ALL clause types present, even if they don't match the section name
2. Look for semantic indicators:
   - Dates, durations, "commence", "expire" → Lease Term
   - Currency, "payment", "monthly", amounts → Rent
   - "repair", "maintain", "responsible for" → Maintenance
   - "assign", "sublet", "transfer" → Assignment
   - "insurance", "liability", "coverage" → Insurance
   - "use", "purpose", "business type" → Use of Premises
   - "entry", "access", "landlord may" → Entry Rights
   - "damage", "fire", "destroyed" → Casualty
   - Legal terms, "default", "breach" → Legal Provisions

3. Extract whatever information IS available, even if incomplete
4. For uncertain matches, include with lower confidence
5. Include any useful legal text that doesn't fit categories in "miscellaneous_clauses"
6. Identify risk factors:
   - Missing important terms (e.g., no notice period)
   - One-sided provisions favoring landlord
   - Placeholder values like [AMOUNT] or TBD
   - Ambiguous or undefined terms

Return JSON in this format:
{
  "detected_clauses": [
    {
      "clause_type": "rent",  // or "term", "insurance", "entry", etc.
      "confidence": 0.95,  // 0.0 to 1.0
      "detection_method": "Found currency amount with 'monthly' keyword",
      "extracted_data": {
        "base_rent": "$5,000/month",
        "payment_date": "1st of month",
        "grace_period": "5 days",
        "late_fee": "[AMOUNT]"  // Include placeholders as-is
      },
      "supporting_text": "Relevant text excerpt...",
      "summary": "Monthly rent of $5,000 due on 1st with 5-day grace period",
      "risk_tags": ["placeholder_late_fee"]  // Add risk tags here
    }
  ],
  "miscellaneous_clauses": {
    // Any other important legal content that doesn't fit standard categories
  }
}

REMEMBER: 
- Always extract something meaningful
- Use inference to identify clauses even in wrong sections
- Flag risks and placeholders
- Never return empty results if text contains legal content
