Section 5.  Changes in Method of Taxation.  Landlord and Tenant further 
agree that if at any time during the term of this Lease, the present method 
of taxation or assessment of real estate shall be changed so that the whole 
or any part of the real estate taxes, assessment or governmental 
impositions now levied, assessed or imposed on the Leased Premises shall, 
in lieu thereof, be assessed, levied, or imposed wholly or in part, as a 
capital levy or otherwise upon the rents reserved herein or any part 
thereof, or as a tax, corporation franchise tax, assessment, levy or 
charge, or any part thereof, measured by or based, in whole or in part, 
upon the Leased Premises or on the rents derived therefrom and imposed upon 
the Landlord, then the Tenant shall pay all such taxes, assessments, 
levies, impositions, or charges.  Nothing contained in this Lease shall 
require the Tenant to pay an estate, inheritance, succession, capital levy, 
corporate franchise, gross receipts, transfer or income tax of the 
Landlord, nor shall any of the same be deemed real estate taxes as defined 
herein unless the same be imposed in lieu of the real estate taxes.  
 
 
ARTICLE VII - CONSTRUCTION AND COMPLETION

specifications for the construction of improvements, and, if so, such plans

Tenant shall negotiate, let and supervise all contracts for the furnishing 
of services, labor, and maerials for the construction of the improvements

improvements during the course of construction shall be on Tenant with the 
proceeds from insurance thereon payable to Landlord.

herein and shall keep the same in force.  
 
Nothing herein shall alter the intent of the parties that Tenant shall be 
fully and completely responsible for all aspects pertaining to the 
construction of the improvements of the demised premises and for the 
payment of all costs associated therewith. Landlord shall be under no duty 
to investigate or verify Tenant's compliance with the provision herein. 
Moreover, neither Tenant nor any third party may construe the permission 
granted Tenant hereunder to create any responsibility on the part of the 
Landlord to pay for any improvements, alterations or repairs occasioned by 
the Tenant. The Tenant shall keep the property free and clear of all liens 
and, should the Tenant fail to do so, or to have any liens removed from the 
property within fourteen (14) days of notification to do so by the Landlord 
, in addition to all other remedies available to the Landlord , the Tenant

including attorney's fees, occasioned by the Landlord in having said lien

regular monthly rental as additional reimburseable expenses to the Landlord 
by the Tenant.  
 
Section 2.  Utilities.  Tenant shall pay for all water, sanitation, sewer, 
 
5 
electricity, light, heat, gas, power, fuel, janitorial, and other services 
incident to Tenant's use of the Leased Premises, whether or not the cost 
thereof be a charge or imposition against the Leased Premises.

Section 1.  LANDLORD'S Repairs.  Subject to any provisions herein to the 
contrary, and except for maintenance or replacement necessitated as the 
result of the act or omission of sublessees, licensees or contractors, the 
Landlord shall be required to repair only defects, deficiencies, deviations 
or failures of materials or workmanship in the building. The Landlord shall 
keep the Leased Premises free of such defects, deficiencies, deviations or 
failures during the first twelve (12) months of the term hereof.

Leased Premises in good order and condition, except for reasonable wear and 
tear, the repairs required of Landlord pursuant hereto, and maintenance or 
replacement necessitated as the result of the act or omission or negligence 
of the Landlord, its employees, agents, or contractors.  
 
Section 3.  Requirements of the Law.  The Tenant agrees that if any 
federal, state or municipal government or any department or division 
thereof shall condemn the Leased Premises or any part thereof as not in 
conformity with the laws and regulations relating to the construction 
thereof as of the commencement date with respect to conditions latent or 
otherwise which existed on the Commencement Date, or, with respect to items 
which are the Landlord's duty to repair pursuant to Section 1 and 3 of this 
Article; and such federal, state or municipal government or any other 
department or division thereof, has ordered or required, or shall hereafter 
order or require, any alterations or repairs thereof or installations and 
repairs as may be necessary to comply with such laws, orders or 
requirements (the validity of which the Tenant shall be entitled to 
contest); and if by reason of such laws, orders or the work done by the 
Landlord in connection therewith, the Tenant is deprived of the use of the 
Leased Premises, the rent shall be abated or adjusted, as the case may be, 
in proportion to that time during which, and to that portion of the Leased

modifications at Landlord's expense.  
 
All such rebuilding, altering, installing and repairing shall be done in 
accordance with Plans and Specifications approved by the Tenant, which 
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. If, however, such 
condemnation, law, order or requirement, as in this Article set forth, 
shall be with respect to an item which shall be the Tenant's obligation to 
 
6 
repair pursuant to Section 2 of this Article VII or with respect to 
Tenant's own costs and expenses, no abatement or adjustment of rent shall 
be granted; provided, however, that Tenant shall also be entitled to 
contest the validity thereof.

sole expense, from time to time, to redecorate the Leased Premises and to 
make such non-structural alterations and changes in such parts thereof as 
the Tenant shall deem expedient or necessary for its purposes; provided, 
however, that such alterations and changes shall neither impair the 
structural soundness nor diminish the value of the Leased Premises. The 
Tenant may make structural alterations and additions to the Leased Premises 
provided that Tenant has first obtained the consent thereto of the Landlord 
in writing. The Landlord agrees that it shall not withhold such consent 
unreasonably. The Landlord shall execute and deliver upon the request of 
the Tenant such instrument or instruments embodying the approval of the 
Landlord which may be required by the public or quasi public authority for

alterations, changes and/or installations in, to or upon the Leased 
Premises and the Tenant agrees to pay for such licenses or permits.  
 
Section 5.  Permits and Expenses.  Each party agrees that it will procure 
all necessary permits for making any repairs, alterations, or other 
improvements for installations, when applicable. Each Party hereto shall 
give written notice to the other party of any repairs required of the other 
pursuant to the provisions of this Article and the party responsible for 
said repairs agrees promptly to commence such repairs and to prosecute the 
same to completion diligently, subject, however, to the delays occasioned 
by events beyond the control of such party.  
 
Each party agrees to pay promptly when due the entire cost of any work done 
by it upon the Leased Premises so that the Leased Premises at all times 
shall be free of liens for labor and materials.  Each party further agrees 
to hold harmless and indemnify the other party from and against any and all 
injury, loss, claims or damage to any person or property occasioned by or 
arising out of the doing of any such work by such party or its employees,
