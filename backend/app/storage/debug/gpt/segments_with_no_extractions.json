Without terminating this Lease, and with or without notice to Tenant, \nLandlord may in its own name but as agent for Tenant enter into and upon \nand take possession of the Premises or any part thereof, and, at landlord's \noption, remove persons and property therefrom, and such property, if any, \nmay be removed and stored in a warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of, and \nfor the account of Tenant, all without being deemed guilty of trespass or \nbecoming liable for any loss or damage which may be occasioned thereby, and \nLandlord may rent the Premises or any portion thereof as the agent of \nTenant with or without advertisement, and by private negotiations and for \nany term upon such terms and conditions as Landlord may deem necessary or \ndesirable in order to relet the Premises. Landlord shall in no way be \nresponsible or liable for any rental concessions or any failure to rent the \nPremises or any part thereof, or for any failure to collect any rent due \nupon such reletting. Upon such reletting, all rentals received by Landlord \nfrom such reletting shall be applied: first, to the payment of any \nindebtedness (other than any rent due hereunder) from Tenant to Landlord; \nsecond, to the payment of any costs and expenses of such reletting, \nincluding, without limitation, brokerage fees and attorney's fees and costs \nof alterations and repairs; third, to the payment of rent and other charges \nthen due and unpaid hereunder; and the residue, if any shall be held by \nLandlord to the extent of and for application in payment of future rent as \nthe same may become due and payable hereunder. In reletting the Premises as \naforesaid, Landlord may grant rent concessions and Tenant shall not be \n \n14 \ncredited therefor. If such rentals received from such reletting shall at \nany time or from time to time be less than sufficient to pay to Landlord \nthe entire sums then due from Tenant hereunder, Tenant shall pay any such \ndeficiency to Landlord. Such deficiency shall, at Landlord's option, be \ncalculated and paid monthly. No such reletting shall be construed as an \nelection by Landlord to terminate this Lease unless a written notice of \nsuch election has been given to Tenant by Landlord. Notwithstanding any \nsuch reletting without termination, Landlord may at any time thereafter \nelect to terminate this Lease for any such previous default provided same \nhas not been cured; or \n \nv.  Without liability to Tenant or any other party and without constituting \na constructive or actual eviction, suspend or discontinue furnishing or \nrendering to Tenant any property, material, labor, Utilities or other \nservice, whether Landlord is obligated to furnish or render the same, so \nlong as Tenant is in default under this Lease; or \n \nvi.  Allow the Premises to remain unoccupied and collect rent from Tenant \nas it comes due; or  \n \nvii.  Foreclose the security interest described herein, including the \nimmediate taking of possession of all property on or in the Premises; or  \n \nviii.  Pursue such other remedies as are available at law or equity.  \n \ne.  Landlord's pursuit of any remedy of remedies, including without \nlimitation, any one or more of the remedies stated herein shall not (1) \nconstitute an election of remedies or preclude pursuit of any other remedy \nor remedies provided in this Lease or any other remedy or remedies provided \nby law or in equity, separately or concurrently or in any combination, or \n(2) sever as the basis for any claim of constructive eviction, or allow \nTenant to withhold any payments under this Lease. \n \nSection 2.  LANDLORD'S Self Help.  If in the performance or observance of \nany agreement or condition in this Lease contained on its part to be \nperformed or observed and shall not cure such default within thirty (30) \ndays after notice from Landlord specifying the default (or if such default \nshall reasonably take more than thirty (30) days to cure, shall diligently \nprosecuted the same to completion), Landlord may, at its option, without \nwaiving any claim for damages for breach of agreement, at any time \nthereafter cure such default for the account of Tenant, and any amount paid \nor contractual liability incurred by Landlord in so doing shall be deemed \npaid or incurred for the account of Tenant and Tenant agrees to reimburse \nLandlord therefor and save Landlord harmless therefrom. Provided, however, \nthat Landlord may cure any such default as aforesaid prior to the \nexpiration of said waiting period, without notice to Tenant if any \n \n15 \nemergency situation exists, or after notice to Tenant, if the curing of \nsuch default prior to the expiration of said waiting period is reasonably \nnecessary to protect the Leased Premises or Landlord's interest therein, or \nto prevent injury or damage to persons or property. If Tenant shall fail to \nreimburse Landlord upon demand for any amount paid for the account of \nTenant hereunder, said amount shall be added to and become due as a part of \nthe next payment of rent due and shall for all purposes be deemed and \ntreated as rent hereunder. \n \nSection 3.  TENANT'S Self Help.  If Landlord shall default in the \nperformance or observance of any agreement or condition in this Lease \ncontained on its part to be performed or observed, and if Landlord shall \nnot cure such default within thirty (30) days after notice from Tenant \nspecifying the default (or, if such default shall reasonably take more than \nthirty (30) days to cure, and Landlord shall not have commenced the same \nwithin the thirty (30) days and diligently prosecuted the same to \ncompletion), Tenant may, at its option, without waiving any claim for \ndamages for breach of agreement, at any time thereafter cure such default \nfor the account of Landlord and any amount paid or any contractual \nliability incurred by Tenant in so doing shall be deemed paid or incurred \nfor the account of Landlord and Landlord shall reimburse Tenant therefor \nand save Tenant harmless therefrom. Provided, however, that Tenant may cure \nany such default as aforesaid prior to the expiration of said waiting \nperiod, without notice to Landlord if an emergency situation exists, or \nafter notice to Landlord , if the curing of such default prior to the \nexpiration of said waiting period is reasonably necessary to protect the \nLeased Premises or Tenant's interest therein or to prevent injury or damage \nto persons or property.  If Landlord shall fail to reimburse Tenant upon \ndemand for any amount paid or liability incurred for the account of \nLandlord hereunder, said amount or liability may be deducted by Tenant from \nthe next or any succeeding payments of rent due hereunder; provided, \nhowever, that should said amount or the liability therefor be disputed by \nLandlord, Landlord may contest its liability or the amount thereof, through \narbitration or through a declaratory judgment action and Landlord shall \nbear the cost of the filing fees therefor. \n \n \nARTICLE XVII - TITLE \n \nSection l.  Subordination.  Tenant shall, upon the request of Landlord in \nwriting, subordinate this Lease to the lien of any present or future \ninstitutional mortgage upon the Leased Premises irrespective of the time of \nexecution or the time of recording of any such mortgage. Provided, however, \nthat as a condition to such subordination, the holder of any such mortgage \nshall enter first into a written agreement with Tenant in form suitable for \nrecording to the effect that: \n \n16 \n \na.  in the event of foreclosure or other action taken under the mortgage by \nthe holder thereof, this Lease and the rights of Tenant hereunder shall not \nbe disturbed but shall continue in full force and effect so long as Tenant \nshall not be in default hereunder, and  \n \nb.  such holder shall permit insurance proceeds and condemnation proceeds \nto be used for any restoration and repair required by the provisions of \nArticles XIII, XIV or XV, respectively.  Tenant agrees that if the \nmortgagee or any person claiming under the mortgagee shall succeed to the \ninterest of Landlord in this Lease, Tenant will recognize said mortgagee or \nperson as its Landlord under the terms of this Lease, provided that said \nmortgagee or person for the period during which said mortgagee or person \nrespectively shall be in possession of the Leased Premises and thereafter \ntheir respective successors in interest shall assume all of the obligations \nof Landlord hereunder. The word \"mortgage\", as used herein includes \nmortgages, deeds of trust or other similar instruments, and modifications, \nand extensions thereof. The term \"institutional mortgage\" as used in this \nArticle XVII means a mortgage securing a loan from a bank (commercial or \nsavings) or trust company, insurance company or pension trust or any other \nlender institutional in nature and constituting a lien upon the Leased \nPremises.  \n \nSection 2.  Quiet Enjoyment.  Landlord covenants and agrees that upon \nTenant paying the rent and observing and performing all of the terms, \ncovenants and conditions on Tenant's part to be observed and performed \nhereunder, that Tenant may peaceably and quietly have, hold, occupy and \nenjoy the Leased Premises in accordance with the terms of this Lease \nwithout hindrance or molestation from Landlord or any persons lawfully \nclaiming through Landlord .  \n \nSection 3.  Zoning and Good Title.  Landlord warrants and represents, upon \nwhich warranty and representation Tenant has relied in the execution of \nthis Lease, that Landlord is the owner of the Leased Premises, in fee \nsimple absolute, free and clear of all encumbrances, except for the \neasements, covenants and restrictions of record as of the date of this \nLease. Such exceptions shall not impede or interfere with the quiet use and \nenjoyment of the Leased Premises by Tenant. Landlord further warrants and \ncovenants that this Lease is and shall be a first lien on the Leased \nPremises, subject only to any Mortgage to which this Lease is subordinate \nor may become subordinate pursuant to an agreement executed by Tenant, and \nto such encumbrances as shall be caused by the acts or omissions of Tenant; \nthat Landlord has full right and lawful authority to execute this Lease for \nthe term, in the manner, and upon the conditions and provisions herein \ncontained; that there is no legal impediment to the use of the Leased \nPremises as set out herein; that the Leased Premises are not subject to any \n \n17 \neasements, restrictions, zoning ordinances or similar governmental \nregulations which prevent their use as set out herein; that the Leased \nPremises presently are zoned for the use contemplated herein and throughout \nthe term of this lease may continue to be so used therefor by virtue of \nsaid zoning, under the doctrine of \"non-conforming use\", or valid and \nbinding decision of appropriate authority, except, however, that said \nrepresentation and warranty by Landlord shall not be applicable in the \nevent that Tenant's act or omission shall invalidate the application of \nsaid zoning, the doctrine of \"non-conforming use\" or the valid and binding \ndecision of the appropriate authority. Landlord shall furnish without \nexpense to Tenant, within thirty (30) days after written request therefor \nby Tenant, a title report covering the Leased Premises showing the \ncondition of title as of the date of such certificate, provided, however, \nthat Landlord's obligation hereunder shall be limited to the furnishing of \nonly one such title report.  \n \nSection 4.  Licenses.  It shall be the Tenant's responsibility to obtain \nany and all necessary licenses and the Landlord shall bear no \nresponsibility therefor; the Tenant shall promptly notify Landlord of the \nfact that it has obtained the necessary licenses in order to prevent any \ndelay to Landlord in commencing construction of the Leased Premises.  \n \n \nARTICLE XVIII - EXTENSIONS/WAIVERS/DISPUTES \n \nSection l.  Extension Period.  Any extension hereof shall be subject to the \nprovisions of Article III hereof.  \n \nSection 2.  Holding Over.  In the event that Tenant or anyone claiming \nunder Tenant shall continue occupancy of the Leased Premises after the \nexpiration of the term of this Lease or any renewal or extension thereof \nwithout any agreement in writing between Landlord and Tenant with respect \nthereto, such occupancy shall not be deemed to extend or renew the term of \nthe Lease, but such occupancy shall continue as a tenancy at will, from \nmonth to month, upon the covenants, provisions and conditions herein \ncontained. The rental shall be the rental in effect during the term of this \nLease as extended or renewed, prorated and payable for the period of such \noccupancy.  \n \nSection 3.  Waivers.  Failure of either party to complain of any act or \nomission on the part of the other party, no matter how long the same may \ncontinue, shall not be deemed to be a waiver by said party of any of its \nrights hereunder. No waiver by either party at any time, express or \nimplied, of any breach of any provision of this Lease shall be deemed a \nwaiver of a breach of any other provision of this Lease or a consent to any \nsubsequent breach of the same or any other provision. If any action by \n \n18 \neither party shall require the consent or approval of the other party, the \nother party's consent to or approval of such action on any one occasion \nshall not be deemed a consent to or approval of said action on any \nsubsequent occasion or a consent to or approval of any other action on the \nsame or any subsequent occasion. Any and all rights and remedies which \neither party may have under this Lease or by operation of law, either at \nlaw or in equity, upon any breach, shall be distinct, separate and \ncumulative and shall not be deemed inconsistent with each other, and no one \nof them, whether exercised by said party or not, shall be deemed to be an \nexclusion of any other; and any two or more or all of such rights and \nremedies may be exercised at the same time.  \n \nSection 4.  Disputes.  It is agreed that, if at any time a dispute shall \narise as to any amount or sum of money to be paid by one party to the other \nunder the provisions hereof, the party against whom the obligation to pay \nthe money is asserted shall have the right to make payment \"under protest\" \nand such payment shall not be regarded as a voluntary payment and there \nshall survive the right on the part of the said party to institute suit for \nthe recovery of such sum. If it shall be adjudged that there was no legal \nobligation on the part of said party to pay such sum or any part thereof, \nsaid party shall be entitled to recover such sum or so much thereof as it \nwas not legally required to pay under the provisions of this Lease. If at \nany time a dispute shall arise between the parties hereto as to any work to \nbe performed by either of them under the provisions hereof, the party \nagainst whom the obligation to perform the work is asserted may perform \nsuch work and pay the costs thereof \"under protest\" and the performance of \nsuch work shall in no event be regarded as a voluntary performance and \nshall survive the right on the part of the said party to institute suit for \nthe recovery of the costs of such work. If it shall be adjudged that there \nwas no legal obligation on the part of the said party to perform the same \nor any part thereof, said party shall be entitled to recover the costs of \nsuch work or the cost of so much thereof as said party was not legally \nrequired to perform under the provisions of this Lease and the amount so \npaid by Tenant may be withheld or deducted by Tenant from any rents herein \nreserved.  \n \nSection 5.  TENANT'S Right to cure LANDLORD'S Default.  In the event that \nLandlord shall fail, refuse or neglect to pay any mortgages, liens or \nencumbrances, the judicial sale of which might affect the interest of \nTenant hereunder, or shall fail, refuse or neglect to pay any interest due \nor payable on any such mortgage, lien or encumbrance, Tenant may pay said \nmortgages, liens or encumbrances, or interest or perform said conditions \nand charge to Landlord the amount so paid and withhold and deduct from any \nrents herein reserved such amounts so paid, and any excess over and above \nthe amounts of said rents shall be paid by Landlord to Tenant.  \n \n \n19 \nSection 6.

Force Majeure.  In the event that Landlord or Tenant shall be \ndelayed or hindered in or prevented from the performance of any act other \nthan Tenant's obligation to make payments of rent, additional rent, and \nother charges required hereunder, by reason of strikes, lockouts, \nunavailability of materials, failure of power, restrictive governmental \nlaws or regulations, riots, insurrections, the act, failure to act, or \ndefault of the other party, war or other reason beyond its control, then \nperformance of such act shall be excused for the period of the delay and \nthe period for the performance of such act shall be extended for a period \nequivalent to the period of such delay.
