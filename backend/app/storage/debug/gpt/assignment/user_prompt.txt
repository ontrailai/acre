20 
hereunder, Tenant shall have the absolute right to transfer and assign this 
lease or to sublet all or any portion of the Leased Premises or to cease 
operating Tenant's business on the Leased Premises provided that at the 
time of such assignment or sublease Tenant shall not be in default in the 
performance and observance of the obligations imposed upon Tenant 
hereunder, and in the event that Tenant assigns or sublets this property 
for an amount in excess of the rental amount then being paid, then Landlord 
shall require as further consideration for the granting of the right to 
assign or sublet, a sum equal to fifty (50%) percent of the difference 
between the amount of rental to be charged by Tenant to Tenant's sublessee 
or assignee and the amount provided for herein, payable in a manner 
consistent with the method of payment by the sublessee or assignee to the 
Tenant, and/or fifty (50%) percent of the consideration paid or to be paid 
to Tenant by Tenant's sublessee or assignee. Landlord must consent in 
writing to any such sublessee or assignee, although such consent shall not 
be unreasonably withheld. The use of the Leased Premises by such assignee 
or sublessee shall be expressly limited by and to the provisions of this 
lease.  
 
Section 2.  Fixtures.  All personal property, furnishings and equipment 
presently and all other trade fixtures installed in or hereafter by or at 
the expense of Tenant and all additions and/or improvements, exclusive of 
structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing, affixed to the Leased 
Premises and used in the operation of the Tenant's business made to, in or 
on the Leased Premises by and at the expense of Tenant and susceptible of 
being removed from the Leased Premises without damage, unless such damage 
be repaired by Tenant, shall remain the property of Tenant and Tenant may, 
but shall not be obligated to, remove the same or any part thereof at any 
time or times during the term hereof, provided that Tenant, at its sole 
cost and expense, shall make any repairs occasioned by such removal.  
 
Section 3.  Estoppel Certificates.  At any time and from time to time, 
Landlord and Tenant each agree, upon request in writing from the other, to 
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the other or to any person designated 
by the other a statement in writing certifying that the Lease is unmodified 
and is in full force and effect, or if there have been modifications, that 
the same is in full force and effect as modified (stating the 
modifications), that the other party is not in default in the performance 
of its covenants hereunder, or if there have been such defaults, specifying 
the same, and the dates to which the rent and other charges have been paid. 
 
 
Section 4.  Invalidity of Particular Provision.  If any term or provision 
of this Lease or the application hereof to any person or circumstance 
shall, to any extent, be held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of 
this Lease, or the application of such term or provision to persons or 
 
21 
circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or 
unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term and provision 
of this Lease shall be valid and be enforced to the fullest extent 
permitted by law.  
 
Section 5.  Captions and Definitions of Parties.  The captions of the 
Sections of this Lease are for convenience only and are not a part of this 
Lease and do not in any way limit or amplify the terms and provisions of 
this Lease. The word "Landlord" and the pronouns referring thereto, shall 
mean, where the context so admits or requires, the persons, firm or 
corporation named herein as Landlord or the mortgagee in possession at any 
time, of the land and building comprising the Leased Premises. If there is 
more than one Landlord, the covenants of Landlord shall be the joint and 
several obligations of each of them, and if Landlord is a partnership, the 
covenants of Landlord shall be the joint and several obligations of each of 
the partners and the obligations of the firm. Any pronoun shall be read in 
the singular or plural and in such gender as the context may require. 
Except as in this Lease otherwise provided, the terms and provisions of 
this Lease shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties 
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.  
 
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed by the parties hereto 
nor by any third party as creating the relationship of principal and agent 
or of partnership or of a joint venture between the parties hereto, it 
being understood and agreed that neither any provision contained herein, 
nor any acts of the parties hereto, shall be deemed to create any 
relationship between the parties hereto other than the relationship of 
Landlord and Tenant.  
 
Section 6.  Brokerage.  No party has acted as, by or through a broker in 
the effectuation of this Agreement, except as set out hereinafter.  
 
Section 7.  Entire Agreement.  This instrument contains the entire and only 
agreement between the parties, and no oral statements or representations or 
prior written matter not contained in this instrument shall have any force 
and effect. This Lease shall not be modified in any way except by a writing 
executed by both parties.  
 
Section 8.  Governing Law. All matters pertaining to this agreement 
(including its interpretation, application, validity, performance and 
breach) in whatever jurisdiction action may be brought, shall be governed 
by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of 
______________. The parties herein waive trial by jury and agree to submit 
to the personal jurisdiction and venue of a court of subject matter 
jurisdiction located in _____________________ County, State of 
______________. In the event that litigation results from or arises out of 
 
22 
this Agreement or the performance thereof, the parties agree to reimburse 
the prevailing party's reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and all 
other expenses, whether or not taxable by the court as costs, in addition 
to any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled. In such 
event, no action shall be entertained by said court or any court of 
competent jurisdiction if filed more than one year subsequent to the date 
the cause(s) of action actually accrued regardless of whether damages were 
otherwise as of said time calculable.  
 
Section 9.  Contractual Procedures.  Unless specifically disallowed by law, 
should litigation arise hereunder, service of process therefor may be 
obtained through certified mail, return receipt requested; the parties 
hereto waiving any and all rights they may have to object to the method by 
which service was perfected.  
 
Section 10.  Extraordinary remedies.  To the extent cognizable at law, the 
parties hereto, in the event of breach and in addition to any and all other 
remedies available thereto, may obtain injunctive relief, regardless of 
whether the injured party can demonstrate that no adequate remedy exists at 
law.  
 
Section 11.  Reliance on Financial Statement.  Tenant shall furnish 
concurrently with the execution of this lease, a financial statement of 
Tenant prepared by an accountant. Tenant, both in corporate capacity, if 
applicable, and individually, hereby represents and warrants that all the 
information contained therein is complete, true, and correct. Tenant 
understands that Landlord is relying upon the accuracy of the information 
contained therein. Should there be found to exist any inaccuracy within the 
financial statement which adversely affects Tenant's financial standing, or 
should Tenant's financial circumstances materially change, Landlord may 
demand, as additional security, an amount equal to an additional two (2) 
months' rent, which additional security shall be subject to all terms and 
conditions herein, require a fully executed guaranty by a third party 
acceptable to Landlord, elect to terminate this Lease, or hold Tenant 
personally and individually liable hereunder. 
 
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Lease the day and 
year first above written or have caused this Lease to be executed by their 
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
