Extract assignment/subletting rules from this clause:

CLAUSE TEXT:
Landlord’s Consent Required.  Tenant shall not assign this Lease, in whole 
or in part, nor sublet all or any part of the Premises, nor license concessions or lease portions 
therein, nor otherwise permit any other person to occupy or use any portion of the Premises 
(collectively, a “Transfer”), without in each instance first obtaining the written consent of 
Landlord.  The consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that, among other 
things as reasonably required by Landlord, the net worth and financial condition of the proposed 
assignee or transferee is provided to Landlord, in writing, with Tenant’s request for Landlord’s 
consent.  This prohibition includes any subletting or assignment which would otherwise occur by 
operation of law, merger, consolidation, reorganization, transfer or other change of Tenant’s 
corporate or proprietary structure (including, without limitation, the transfer of partnership 
interests, the creation of additional partnership interests or the transfer of corporate shares or 
beneficial interests), or an assignment or subletting to or by a receiver or trustee in any federal or 
state bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings.  Consent by Landlord to any 
assignment, subletting, licensing or other transfer shall not (i) constitute a waiver of the 
requirement for such consent to any subsequent assignment, subletting, licensing or other 
Transfer, (ii) relieve Tenant from its duties, responsibilities and obligations under the Lease, or 
(iii) relieve any guarantor of this Lease from such guarantor’s obligations under its guaranty 
agreement, if any, except that any of the above may be waived upon agreement by Landlord.
