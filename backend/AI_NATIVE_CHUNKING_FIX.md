# Fixed: AI-Native Extraction Now Uses Pre-Chunked Segments

## The Problem
The AI-native extractor was trying to process the entire 39KB document as one piece, causing timeouts. Meanwhile, the recursive chunker had already created 18 well-sized chunks (each 700-9000 chars).

## The Solution
Modified the AI-native extraction to:

1. **Use the existing chunks** - No more re-chunking or document structure analysis
2. **Process each chunk independently** - Each of the 18 segments gets its own GPT call
3. **Parallel processing** - Up to 5 chunks processed simultaneously
4. **Direct extraction** - Straight to extracting data from each chunk

## How It Works Now

1. **Recursive chunker creates segments** (18 chunks like rent, security_deposit, pet_policy, etc.)
2. **AI-native receives these segments** directly
3. **Each segment is processed separately**:
   - Rent section (7927 chars) → GPT extracts all rent-related data
   - Security deposit section (9313 chars) → GPT extracts deposit info
   - Pet policy (3129 chars) → GPT extracts pet-related terms
   - etc.
4. **Results are combined** into structured ClauseExtraction objects

## Benefits
- No more timeouts on document structure analysis
- Each chunk is a manageable size for GPT-4
- Parallel processing speeds up extraction
- All 18 segments get fully processed
- Rich data extraction from each section

The system now properly leverages the recursive chunking output instead of trying to process the entire document at once.
